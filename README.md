# AI-powered-flashcard-generator


📚 Ever felt buried under pages of notes or PDFs when studying? What if AI could turn them into flashcards for you? That’s exactly what I set out to build with my AI-powered flashcard generator! 🚀

I created a tool that takes any PDF, Word doc, or text file, extracts the content, summarizes it, and generates Q&A flashcards to make studying smarter and faster. Using Python, NLP, and tools like Streamlit, it’s a project I’m excited to share because it blends tech with learning.

Why did I build this? I wanted to help students and myself save time and focus on understanding, not memorizing. Whether you’re preparing for exams or learning new skills, this kind of tool can change the game.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll break it down step-by-step in a series—starting with the basics of reading files, diving into AI models like BART and T5, and ending with a full app. My goal? To help you to build something similar and show what’s possible with AI and Python.

Here’s the app in action! 👇
