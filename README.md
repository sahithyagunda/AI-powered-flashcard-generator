# AI-powered-flashcard-generator


ðŸ“š Ever felt buried under pages of notes or PDFs when studying? What if AI could turn them into flashcards for you? Thatâ€™s exactly what I set out to build with my AI-powered flashcard generator! ðŸš€

I created a tool that takes any PDF, Word doc, or text file, extracts the content, summarizes it, and generates Q&A flashcards to make studying smarter and faster. Using Python, NLP, and tools like Streamlit, itâ€™s a project Iâ€™m excited to share because it blends tech with learning.

Why did I build this? I wanted to help students and myself save time and focus on understanding, not memorizing. Whether youâ€™re preparing for exams or learning new skills, this kind of tool can change the game.
